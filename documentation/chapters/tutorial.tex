\subsubsection{Pitfalls}

\paragraph{Compile with -finstrument-functions} 
\paragraph{Compile with -fno-inline} This disables the inlining of functions which is done by the compiler automatically to optimize execution speed by eliminating function call overhead. Since we are profiling on a function execution level, we cannot profile inlined function, so all the functions inlined by the compiler cannot appear in the call graph. To be sure this cannot happen, use -fno-inline as a gcc option. You might skip this if you want. You still might get good profiling results for the calls you are interested in, but you have been warned! Take care!
