\section{Final words} So this is the end of the CGA porting project. Finally, we had to realize, that it was quite a challenge to port the fact extraction process to two new platforms. Mac OS X and Linux are quite similar, but when it comes to executables, dynamic libraries and other operating system specific internals, they differ a lot. We learned a lot about bloddy internals. This was hard work, but fun as well. 

Thanks to the CGA team for providing a cosy seminar atmosphere and always helping us when we had a question.
